Importance of learning data structure and algorithms
- compare trade-offs between different algorithm
- know which data structure to use; list or array
- techniques for solving problems


Question : 
1) sorted list of 128 using binary search, what is the max steps needed? 
--> Log 128 -> so its 7 
2) Suppose you double the size, whats the max steps now?
--> 8 because double means 256, and I just need to multiple a 2 and thats it, so 7 + 1
