Before we start,
1. Normal stack: can push/pop anything, no ordering guarentee
Monotonic stack = a stack that stays in one order the whole time.
Monotonic increasing stack: numbers in the stack go up (bottom → top).
Monotonic decreasing stack: numbers in the stack go down.

You scan left → right.
When a new number would “break the order”, you pop until the order is fixed.
Why it’s useful: it helps you quickly find the next bigger or next smaller thing.



LC496 (warm-up: next greater w/ stack + map)

LC739 (next greater to the right)

LC503 (circular next greater)

LC901 (span = previous greater)

LC84 (histogram core)

LC907 (range contribution w/ next smaller)

LC42 (trap w/ stack version)

LC155 (quick cooldown)
