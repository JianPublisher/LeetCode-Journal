For each problem, write 2 lines in notes

Invariant -> stays true every loop

Start ( 5 mins )
Pattern: Two pointers
Invariant: outside [l, r] already matched, only need to compare inside

20 min code in Java without looking
If stuck at 20: read hint/idea, then finish coding

( after u finish coding )
Pattern:2 pointers
When: compare from both ends
Core loop: skip invalid, compare lowercase, l++ r--
Bug: forgot skipping/ lowercase, wrong pointer move

Invariant is the thing that stays true while you loop
