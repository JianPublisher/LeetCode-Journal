Min heap always let you take out the smallest item first

Min heap is a priorityQueue
- offer() -> push
- peek()
- poll() -> returns the smallest value

We use heap when we want the best item so far (biggest/smallest) while things keep coming, or we need to merge sorted sources
Example - Top K - keep 10 largest numbers seen so far
		- Streaming - numbers arrive 1 by 1, always ask current smallest or largest
		- Merge - merge k sorted lists / k sorted rows

Min heap vs Max Heap
- min gives smallest -> when to use? When I want give me the smallest
- max gives largest -> when to use? keep only the smallest, kick out the largest, so offer would kick out the largest

Comparator - we give a function
-> if return negative -> a comes before b
-> if positive -> a comes after b
-> 0 -> equal
we normally do (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]
but using Integer.compare(a, b) is safer

ascending is Integer.compare(a, b)
descending is Integer.compare(b, a)
