Graph basics
Node (vertex)
Edge - connection

If Alaska touches Kamchatka and Alberta
Alaska -> [Kamchatka, Alberta]


Imagine theres 6 territories
A B C D E F

A touches B, D
B touches A, C E,
C touches B, F
D touches A, E
E touches B, D, F
F touches C, E

To utilize graph, we need to turn this map into adjacency list
A -> [B, D]
B -> [A, C, E]
C -> [B, F]
D -> [A, E]
E -> [B, D, F]
F -> [C, E]

Say if A wants to contact another territory, you can only contact neighbor if
Rule:
you own "from"
territory own "to"
"to" is in neighbors[from]

Example: A contact C is not possible, but A contact B is possible
