25 / 5 = 5
dividend / divisor = quotient

1) Integer.MIN_VALUE ends at 8 while Integer.MAX_VALUE ends at 7
- Integer.MIN_VALUE -2,147,483,648
- Integer.MAX_VALUE 2,147,483,647

First case scenario to think of : If we divide min by -1, it becomes 2,417,483,648 == overflow, so we have if statement to handle this.

2) Whether divisor has negative or not is important. We can just check if we need to put negative on end result
- check if whichever side is negative

3) Now we look at the dividend and divisor. To avoid any overflow issue, we should swap it all to negative
- if dividend is positive, make it negative
- if divisor is positive, make it negative

4) We do repeated subtraction. Technically it would cause timeout since we loop and keep subtracting, and each minus we do result++
- result is quotient btw
